# Simple Snake Game in Python

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python. It's designed as a refresher project to get acquainted with Python programming after a long time of not using it. 

# Libraries
- `tkinter` for the graphical user interface
- `random` library for spawning food items at random positions on the game board.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed on your computer to run this game. You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This game was developed using Python 3.x.

### Running the Game

To run the game, simply clone this repository or download the source code as a zip file and extract it. Navigate to the directory containing the game files in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

## How to Play

- The snake can be controlled using the `WASD` keys or the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) on your keyboard.
- Your objective is to eat as many food items as possible to grow the snake's length.
- The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own tail.

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used.
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
- [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) - The Python module used to generate random numbers for food spawning.
